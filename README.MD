# CAOS Sublime Text Package

This Package provides Syntax highlighting and a basic "builder" conf for the CAOS Script Language, used by the Games [Creatures 3](http://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Creatures_3), [Creatures Dockingstation](http://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Docking_Station), [Creatures Village](http://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Creatures_Village).

# Installation

This package cannot be installed via Package Control jet, because i did not look into that.

Just take the CAOS folder out of this repo and place it within your `Packages` folder.

# Configuration

Set the Correct Path in the `CAOS.sublime-build` file to the Path where you store your Caos Injector (i.E. `CAOS Sublime Builder.exe` [LINK](https://github.com/Ham5ter/CAOS-Sublime-Builder))
